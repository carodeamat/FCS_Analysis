```

## Transformation

This is an R Markdown document to pre-process FCS files by applying transformation to parameter values. 

## Load packages and utilities
```{r}

library(tidyverse)
library(flowCore)
library(flowVS)
library(FlowSOM)
library(Rphenograph)
library(Rtsne)
library(umap)
library(ggcyto)
library(pheatmap)
library(viridis)
library(scales)
library(reshape2)


```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
